## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for the detection of Parkinson's disease using various clinical features and voice recordings. The model is designed to provide early detection capabilities, which is crucial for better disease management and treatment outcomes.

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach to Parkinson's disease detection:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collection of voice recordings and clinical features
   - Feature extraction and normalization
   - Data splitting into training and testing sets

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of a deep neural network
   - Training with early stopping and model checkpointing
   - Hyperparameter optimization

3. **Evaluation and Validation**
   - Cross-validation
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Model interpretation

## Data

The dataset includes:
- Voice recordings from patients
- Clinical features
- Demographic information
- Disease progression markers

### Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
2. Train-test split (80-20)
3. Data augmentation for balanced classes

## Model Architecture

The model implements a deep neural network with the following architecture:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
